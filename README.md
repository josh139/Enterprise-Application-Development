My product is software for a project management system. The idea of my product is to  create companies and then create projects for these companies. Users will then be 
added to  the projects, and finally tickets will be added to the users. This is so you can keep track of  who’s working on which project and who’s working on which task 
within the project. The final product will act as a project management system.

The project management system has been implemented using ASP.NET in visual studio.
